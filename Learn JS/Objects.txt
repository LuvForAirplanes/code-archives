-Referance TYpes Objects:
JavaScript does not support classes as objects
Objects consist of:
- - - - - - - - - - - -
A Constructor     -a function that is called every time one of your objects based on this referance type is created
Method Definitions-
Properties	  -

USE UPPER CASE LETTERS TO DEFINE REFERANCE TYPES!!!-It makes access to referance types easy

defining A Referance type
1.Create Constructor:
function.person(firstName, lastName) {
this.firstName = firstName;
this.lastName = lastName;
}

ObjectName.prototype

-Custom objects:
You can create new objects without telling JS directly; simply type: myObject.NewThing = "Value"
One drawback, if you misspell JS wont tell you, it'll simply create a new property

var myObject = {};
myObject.first = "Micah";
myObject.last = "Stauffer";

-or-

var myObject = {
first:"Micah",
last:"Doe",
greet:function() {
alert("My name is " + 
this.first = " " +
this.last;
}
};

Assign a function:
myObject.greet - function() {
alert("My name is " + this.first + " " + this.last;
